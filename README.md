 # LSTM: (Long short-term memory)
The main purpose of LSTM is to bring a solution to the “short-term memory” issue of RNN.
LSTM has gates that learn the data. If the sequence is important, they store it or it is discarded.
It is due to this that only the relevant information is stored in gates. This way, only this relevant
information is used for making predictions.

# LSTM Time Series model for predicting stock market: 
Using Time Series sequence modelling only uses 1 attribute, so it may not be that accurate, and
not to mention, the high volatile and the unexpected nature of the stock market. However,
stock market is not a stochastic process; there is always a pattern and a relation with historical
data. This is an attempt to find the approximate movement of the stock trends.
